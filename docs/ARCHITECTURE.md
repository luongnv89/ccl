# Architecture

This document describes the system design of `claude-codex-local`.

## Overview

`claude-codex-local` is a **local backend bridge** that sits between Claude Code, Codex CLI, or Pi (the AI coding harness the user already knows) and a locally-running LLM server. It does not replace or modify the harness — it teaches the harness to talk to a local model instead of the Anthropic / OpenAI cloud.

## Three Layers

### 1. Machine profile + model recommendation (`claude_codex_local/core.py`)

- `profile` — dumps a JSON snapshot of installed harnesses, engines, `llmfit`, and free disk
- `recommend` — picks the best-fit installed coding model for the hardware
- `doctor` — pretty-prints the current wizard state and re-runs presence checks
- `adapters` — lists the registered `RuntimeAdapter` implementations (ollama, lmstudio, llamacpp, vllm, 9router, openrouter)

These are reachable for debugging via `python -m claude_codex_local.core <cmd>`. There is no user-facing binary for them — they return JSON for scripting and introspection.

### 2. Interactive setup wizard + CLI (`claude_codex_local/wizard.py`)

The wizard is exposed as the `ccl` binary (installed by `[project.scripts]` in `pyproject.toml`).

A 9-step wizard that runs once (or with `--resume` after a failure):

| Step | Action                                                                     |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Load cached environment snapshot (lazy llmfit — see `--run-llmfit`)        |
| 2    | Defer install prompts until a concrete selection is made                   |
| 3    | Ask which harness + engine to use, then live-check only those selections   |
| 4    | Ask which model (or auto-pick via `llmfit`, installed on-demand if needed) |
| 5    | Smoke-test the engine with the chosen model                                |
| 6    | Wire up the harness                                                        |
| 7    | Install helper script + shell aliases (`cc` / `cx` / `cp`)                 |
| 8    | End-to-end verification                                                    |
| 9    | Generate personalized `guide.md`                                           |

State is persisted to `.claude-codex-local/wizard-state.json` so a failed run can be resumed without starting over.

### 3. Helper scripts + shell aliases

The user-facing surface after setup:

- `.claude-codex-local/bin/cc` / `cx` / `cp` / `cc9` / `cx9` / `cp9` / `cco` / `cxo` / `cpo` — a short bash wrapper that invokes the configured launch command. The `*9` helpers are installed when the user picks the 9router engine and the `*o` helpers when the user picks OpenRouter; all three families coexist with the local-engine helpers so a single machine can run any combination of backends.
- `~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc` — one fenced block per **install** (`# >>> claude-codex-local:claude >>>` for Claude+local-engine, `# >>> claude-codex-local:pi9 >>>` for Pi+9router, `# >>> claude-codex-local:claudeo >>>` for Claude+OpenRouter, etc.). Fence tags are derived at the alias-emission site as `f"{harness}9"` for 9router, `f"{harness}o"` for OpenRouter, and `harness` otherwise — so `state.primary_harness` stays semantic ("claude" / "codex" / "pi") while the fence-tag stays presentational. Each block is idempotently replaced on re-run of its own install, and all blocks coexist. A one-shot migration rewraps any legacy (pre-#16) unified block into the per-harness format.

### `WireResult.raw_env` — deferred-secret pattern

`WireResult` carries two env dicts:

- `env: dict[str, str]` — emitted into the helper script with `shlex.quote(value)`. Use for plain values like base URLs.
- `raw_env: dict[str, str]` — emitted **verbatim** into the helper script (no `shlex.quote`). Use ONLY for shell expressions originating in this codebase, never user input. The 9router wiring uses `raw_env={"ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": '"$(cat /path/to/key)"'}` so the API key stays in a chmod-600 file and is read at exec time, never embedded in the script body or in `wizard-state.json`.

## Engine Strategies

### Ollama (primary)

Uses `ollama launch claude --model <tag>`, an official Ollama subcommand that:

- Sets the right env vars internally
- Execs the user's real `claude` binary against the local Ollama daemon
- Preserves `~/.claude` exactly as-is — skills, agents, MCP servers all work

### LM Studio / llama.cpp (secondary)

Uses an inline-env approach for Claude Code and Codex: the helper script exports `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and related vars, then execs the harness. Pi uses its documented custom-provider mechanism instead: CCL writes an isolated `{STATE_DIR}/pi-agent/models.json`, sets `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, and launches `pi --provider ccl-<engine> --model <tag>`.

### 9router (cloud-routing proxy, optional)

[9router](https://github.com/decolua/9router) is a local server that exposes an OpenAI-compatible API on `http://localhost:20128/v1` and forwards calls to paid cloud models (e.g. `kr/claude-sonnet-4.5`). The CCL adapter:

- **Detects via `GET /v1/models`** with a 5-second timeout — never `/chat/completions`, since each chat call burns paid quota.
- **Uses the deferred-secret pattern** (see `WireResult.raw_env` above): the API key is stored in `~/.claude-codex-local/9router-api-key` (chmod 0600) and the helper script reads it at exec time via `$(cat …)`.
- **Skips Step 7 chat-verification.** The standard verify step runs `claude --model <tag> -p "Reply with exactly READY"`. For 9router this would issue a real paid `/chat/completions` call, so the wizard short-circuits with a `/v1/models` reachability check and records `state.verify_result = {"ok": ..., "via": "9router-models-endpoint", "skipped_chat": True}`.
- **Does not download or score models.** Step 4 has a dedicated `_step_4_pick_model_9router` branch that prompts for an API key + model name (default `kr/claude-sonnet-4.5`) and skips llmfit / disk / download paths entirely.

### OpenRouter (hosted cloud-routing service, optional)

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) is a hosted-SaaS counterpart to 9router. It exposes the same OpenAI-compatible API at `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` and forwards calls to paid cloud models (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`, `openai/gpt-4o`, `meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct`). The CCL adapter mirrors `Router9Adapter` with three deliberate divergences:

- **No install path.** OpenRouter is hosted at openrouter.ai — there is no daemon to install or start. `_ensure_tool("openrouter")` only informs the user that the API-key prompt happens in Step 4 and returns `True` even when offline so the wizard does not block on transient network issues.
- **Network detection.** `OpenRouterAdapter.detect()` hits the real HTTPS endpoint at `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` with a 5-second timeout. It tolerates URL errors, timeouts, and non-2xx responses gracefully (returns `present=False` rather than raising) so the wizard's discover step works on machines without internet access.
- **Attribution headers.** The wire env sets `HTTP_REFERER=https://github.com/luongnv89/ccl` and `X_TITLE=claude-codex-local` per OpenRouter convention. These are decorative — the harness may or may not forward them as actual HTTP headers — but they are not secrets and live in plain `env`, not `raw_env`.

Everything else (key file at `~/.claude-codex-local/openrouter-api-key` chmod 0600, deferred-secret pattern, Step 7 chat skip, fence tags `claudeo` / `codexo` / `pio`, helper aliases `cco` / `cxo` / `cpo`) follows the 9router shape exactly.

## Isolation Rule

**The wizard never writes to `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, or the default `~/.pi/agent`.**

All state is isolated under `.claude-codex-local/` (or `$CLAUDE_CODEX_LOCAL_STATE_DIR`). The user's global config is always used read-only; Pi's CCL-specific model config lives under `.claude-codex-local/pi-agent/models.json`.

## Rollback

Remove the alias block from `~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc` and delete `.claude-codex-local/`. The original `claude` / `codex` / `pi` commands are unaffected.
